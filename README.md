# Stability-Analysis-using-Quadratic-Constraints-for-Systems-with-Neural-Network-Controllers
This code is to accompany the paper [Stability Analysis using Quadratic Constraints for Systems with Neural Network Controllers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07579.pdf). It computes an ellipsoidal inner-approximation to the region of attraction of NN controlled-systems.
